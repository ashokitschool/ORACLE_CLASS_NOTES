MYSQL Database
***************
* It is also one of Relational Database Software which maintains the data in the form Rows & Columns as Tables.

* The Name of MySQL is a combination for two words MY & SQL i.e.,MYSQL

* The reason behind adding My is the daughter’s name of the MySQL’s co-founder, Monty Widenius.

* It is an Open Source Database when it comes for Oracle is Properitary License.

* As we discussed earlier By using Structured Query Language(SQL) We can interact with any RDBMS Database Software.

* SQL Commands are command for every database slightly datatypes will be changed from one database to another database.

Interacting with MySQL Database
===============================
* For Every Database we have two options to interact it

    1) CLI Interface i.e., Command Line Interface

        Example : Oracle Database  >>>>> Run SQL Command Line (Goto Start Menu >>>> Search word as "SQL")

                  MYSQL Database   >>>>> MYSQL8.0 Command Line Client(Goto Start Menu  >>>>> "MySQL")

    2) GUI Interface 

         Example : Oracle Database >>>>> SQL Developer etc.,

                   MYSQL Database  >>>>> MySQL WorkBench,MYSQLYOG etc.,

 NOTE
 ====
  Oracle Database >>>> DBA Account is  "system/manager".

  MYSQL Database  >>>> DBA Account is  "root/root".


*****************************************************
Connecting with DBA Account(root) using CLI Interface
******************************************************

Step-1 : Hit on Start button in keyword will get into Start Menu  >>> Search for Word "Mysql" 
                                                                  >>> Select "MySQL 8.0 CommandLine Client" option


Step-2 : After selecting the above option will get Command Line interface by prompting password for root account

                Enter password : root(****)

         NOTE: MYSQL 8.0 Command Line Client always used for connecting root account only.

Step-3 : Getting to know the user name of the account

          Mysql> select current_user();

          O/P : root@localhost

Step-4 : Getting to know about databases in the root account

          MYSQL> show databases

          O/P : Will get the list of database which comes along with MYSQL Installation process

                                (or)

                Preloaded Databases

Step-5 : Creating our own Database for application 

          MYSQL>>>> create database <database_name>

          MYSQL>>>> create datatabase ashokit;

           O/P: Query Ok,0 Rows are affected

         Validating database is created or not 
     
           MYSQL> show databases
OUTPUT:
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| ashokit            |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sakila             |
| sys                |
| world              |
+--------------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Step-6 : Connecting to particular database(ashokit) from the above list of database

         MYSQL> use <database_name>

         MYSQL> user ashokit

    O/P: Database changed

Step-7 : Getting to know what tables are available in database(ashokit)

         MYSQL> show tables

         O/P: EmptySet (No tables are available under ashokit)

Step-8 : Creating the new Database table with following commands

     MYSQL>create table ashokit_customers(customer_id bigint,customer_name varchar(50),customer_location varchar(50));

     MYSQL> insert into ashokit_customers values(1,'Mahesh','Hyderabad');

     mysql> insert into ashokit_customers values(4, 'Ashok','Hyderabad');
         Query OK, 1 row affected (0.12 sec)

     mysql> insert into ashokit_customers values(5, 'Nagesh','Hyderabad');
           Query OK, 1 row affected (0.14 sec)

     mysql> insert into ashokit_customers values(6, 'Anil','Chennai');
          Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)

       NOTE: Need to Insert some customer Records into Table (11 Records)

     mysql> update ashokit_customers set customer_location='Bangalore' where customer_id=6;
           Query OK, 1 row affected (0.10 sec)
           Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

     mysql> delete from ashokit_customers where customer_id=11;
           Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> select * from ashokit_customers;

OUTPUT
======
+-------------+---------------+-------------------+
| customer_id | customer_name | customer_location |
+-------------+---------------+-------------------+
|           1 | Mahesh        | Hyderabad         |

Connecting with DBA Account(root) using GUI Interface
******************************************************
Step-1 : Goto Start Menu  >>>> Search for word "workbench" >>> Find the option "MySQL WorkBench 8.0 CE" >> Click on this          option

Step-2 : Activating the Particular Database from Schemas Explorer

        Activating the particular database is nothing but double clicking on ashokit (Bold Letters)


Step-3: Right Side we workplace to execute the SQL Queries

        select * from ashokit_customers;

        Toolbar :::: First Icon >>> open
                     second Icon >>>> Save
                     Third Icon  >>>> Execute

          BY Default Autocommit is enabled in mysql if you want to disable click on "AutoCommit" Icon in Tool bar.


Step-4 : Created New users from Root account or DBA Account

         -- we can create an users in mysql database as well through DBA Account always
         create user 'suresh'@'localhost' identified by 'suresh';
         create user 'naresh'@'localhost' identified by 'naresh';

         -- providing the permission for creating,inserting,updating,deleting on Database object
         grant all privileges on *.* to suresh@localhost;
         grant all privileges on *.* to naresh@localhost;

Step-5: Connecting users accounts using "MYSQL Work Bench"

        Open MySQL Work Bench >>> Click on home button >>> Click on + Icon for Creating new Connection 

                              >>> Connection Name  ::: Suresh_connection

                                  Username :::: suresh

                                  password :::: suresh
  
                              >>>> Click on Test COnnection button >>> will Get successful made the connection.
